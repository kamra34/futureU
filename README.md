Initial name for the company/page is currently "futureU". This can, however, change based on the team input.

The html files are modified versions of "startup" template on w3schools. You can find the original template here:
https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_startup.htm

The required css file (named "w3.css") is downladed and available locally. Modifications and devlopments are so far done on a local device. Currently, there is no host (neither for the page nor for the files).

Open issues :
1. Decide and act on where to host and run. Which country? which server? etc.
2. Structure needs to be agreed upon. Still immature.
2. Content is also immature. What to add? modify content, etc.

Considerations:
1.  index.html is messy and full of comments. We'll clean them up prior to launch.
2.  font-awesome.min.css is currently being read from cloudfare. Might need to fix that
3. team.html is currently unused. Need to decide if want to include such info or not.
